# MSSNGR

*If you're missing the old Facebook chat.*

## DISCLAIMER

- All credit goes to Facebook Inc.
- The only purpose of this app is to eliminate the need to install Messenger.
- This app ONLY STARTS the ORIGINAL Facebook "Chat", that's why IT REQUIRES the Facebook App.
- This will only work until Facebook removes the original chat from their App.
- THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS".

## THE PROBLEM

1. You (re)install the Facebook app.
2. You can use the old/original Facebook "chat" for a couple of days.
3. After a couple of days Facebook app says "We've moved Over to Messenger, Get App".
4. GOTO 1.

## THE SOLUTION

*(Because we don't like GOTO.)*

1. You install the Facebook App.
2. You install MSSNGR.

## USE CASE

- Alice sends you a message.
- You tap the notification.
- Facebook App wants to make you download the Messenger.
- Obviously you don't download the Messenger.
- You start the MSSNGR and create a NEW chat with Alice. *(Saying "hi" to Alice.)*
    - *(Yes, if you close the Facebook App, you have to start a new chat.)*
- MAGIC HAPPENS
- You can read the previously sent messages between you and Alice.
